# Kyuclid brand sheet

**Kyuclid** = *kyu* (the martial-arts rank) + *Euclid*. Say it "cue-clid". In running text write **Kyuclid**: not KyuClid, Kyu-clid or KYUCLID (capitals are only for the wordmark). Kevin chose the name on 30 Oct 2026 to replace "MathWars"; [name-report.md](name-report.md) explains why.

## Copy

**Tagline:** Contest maths, belt by belt.

**Kevinvariant link card** (replaces the MathWars paragraph in Kevinvariant's `compete.html`; once live duels ship (task 14), change "a timed ghost" to "another solver"):

> Kyuclid ranks contest problems like martial-arts belts, from 8 kyu warm-ups at UKMT Junior and AMC 8 level up to 1 kyu IMO proofs. Answers are checked instantly, proofs are marked against a rubric, and you can duel a timed ghost on the same problem. Every solve earns points and moves you up the belts. A separate site, still a first draft.

**Kevinvariant menu note** (`site.js`): Ranked contest problems, 8 kyu to IMO

**Social bios:**

| Where | Text |
|---|---|
| X / Bluesky / Threads (≤160) | Contest maths, belt by belt. Ranked problems from 8 kyu warm-ups to 1 kyu IMO proofs. Solve, climb, duel. A Kevinvariant project. |
| Instagram / TikTok (≤80) | Contest maths, belt by belt. 8 kyu → IMO. |
| GitHub repo description | Kyuclid: a ranked dojo for contest maths, from 8 kyu warm-ups to 1 kyu IMO proofs. |
| YouTube / Discord (longer) | Kyuclid is a ranked dojo for competition maths. Every problem has a belt, from 8 kyu warm-ups at UKMT Junior and AMC 8 level to 1 kyu olympiad proofs. Solve to earn points, climb the belts and duel a timed ghost on the same problem. Made by Kevin Hu, a Kevinvariant project. |

**Voice:** plain British English (maths, colour, practise as a verb). Short, specific sentences. Name the contests (AMC, AIME, UKMT, BMO, IMO) rather than saying "competitions". The dojo framing is a seasoning: use "belt", "kyu" and "dan" because they're the rank system, and skip "sensei", "grasshopper" and similar.

## Logo

Kevin chose this logo on 31 Oct 2026.

| File | Use |
|---|---|
| `assets/logo/kyuclid-horizontal.svg` | Main logo on light backgrounds |
| `assets/logo/kyuclid-horizontal-dark.svg` | Main logo on dark backgrounds |
| `assets/logo/kyuclid-square.svg`, `-square-dark.svg` | Avatars, link cards and anywhere square: the mark above the wordmark on a solid tile |
| `assets/logo/kyuclid-wordmark.svg`, `-wordmark-dark.svg` | Wordmark alone, where the mark is already shown nearby |
| `assets/logo/kyuclid-mark.svg`, `-mark-dark.svg` | The mark alone (transparent) |
| `assets/logo/mark.svg` | The symbol the site header draws, using the current theme's colours |
| `assets/favicon.svg`, `assets/icons/*` | Browser and app icons (see below) |

**Construction.**
- **Mark:** Euclid's Elements, Book I, Proposition 1. Two solid discs of radius *r*, with centres *r* apart and their overlap cut out. The vermilion equilateral triangle has its corners exactly on the two centres and the upper crossing point. The mark is 3*r* wide and 2*r* tall.
- **Wordmark:** kyuclid, always lowercase, in Bricolage Grotesque 800 at optical size 96, tracked −0.012 em and converted to outlines so it renders without the font.
- **Lockup:** the discs are 0.86 em tall, centred on the middle of the x-height, with a 0.24 em gap before the wordmark.
- **Icons:** a bare mark would vanish on a browser tab of the same colour, so the favicon and app icons put it on the dark indigo tile.

**Usage.**
- **Clear space:** leave at least one disc radius clear on every side of the logo.
- **Minimum size:** the horizontal logo is 80 px wide. Below that, use the mark alone.
- **Backgrounds:** on photos or busy backgrounds, put the logo on a solid tile.
- **Don't:**
  - tilt the mark or change its proportions;
  - set the wordmark in another typeface or in capitals;
  - colour the triangle anything but the two vermilions;
  - add effects.

## Colour

Tokens are the CSS custom properties at the top of `css/site.css`. Dark comes first and is the bare `:root`. Light applies when `data-theme="light"` is set, which the theme button does and stores under `kyuclid:theme` (a separate key from `mathwars:v1`, so it isn't part of anyone's progress). The site doesn't follow the operating system's setting.

| Token | Role | Dark | Light |
|---|---|---|---|
| `--bg` | page background | `#0D1322` | `#F4F3EF` |
| `--surface` | cards | `#151D31` | `#FFFFFF` |
| `--raise` | hover, buttons, your row | `#1D2741` | `#ECEBE5` |
| `--sunk` | wells, empty tracks | `#0A0F1C` | `#E7E6DF` |
| `--line` | borders | `#2C3756` | `#D3D1C7` |
| `--line-soft` | dividers | `#202A44` | `#E4E2DA` |
| `--ink` | text | `#F1EFE9` | `#141B33` |
| `--ink-soft` | secondary text | `#B6BDD0` | `#424A63` |
| `--ink-faint` | captions, meta | `#8E97B0` | `#5C647C` |
| `--shu` | logo triangle, primary buttons | `#F2583F` | `#C4301B` |
| `--shu-hover` | primary hover | `#FF7059` | `#A32512` |
| `--on-shu` | text on shu | `#1A0703` | `#FFFFFF` |
| `--ok` | correct | `#4FCB8F` | `#1C7048` |
| `--bad` | wrong | `#FF8097` | `#B42B4A` |
| `--focus` | links, focus rings | `#A3B5FF` | `#2F3FA8` |
| `--rail` | navigation rail and duel scoreboard | `#0A0F1C` | `#121A33` |

The rail stays dark indigo in both themes, so light mode still looks like Kyuclid. Vermilion is the only accent. Keep it for the logo's triangle and primary actions, and let the belts carry the rest of the colour.

## Belts

The kyu badge is a tied belt, drawn by `beltSvg` in `js/lib/ranks.js`: a band, a square knot with the rank number in it, and two tails that each end in a rank bar. Black belts carry one gold stripe per dan. A problem card wears its belt as a strip along its top edge, and in the problem list the belt runs across the list as the divider above each kyu. Belt colours mean rank and nothing else, so don't use them for decoration. Points per solve follow the Fibonacci numbers.

| Rank | Belt | Fill | Label ink | Tape | Points |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8 kyu | White | `#F4F4F1` | `#1B1E33` | `#15161C` | 2 |
| 7 kyu | Yellow | `#E9C440` | `#1B1E33` | `#15161C` | 3 |
| 6 kyu | Orange | `#E5832A` | `#1B1E33` | `#15161C` | 5 |
| 5 kyu | Green | `#2B864B` | `#FFFFFF` | `#15161C` | 8 |
| 4 kyu | Blue | `#2A64C8` | `#FFFFFF` | `#15161C` | 13 |
| 3 kyu | Purple | `#6E43B8` | `#FFFFFF` | `#15161C` | 21 |
| 2 kyu | Brown | `#7A4A2B` | `#FFFFFF` | `#15161C` | 34 |
| 1 kyu | Red | `#B8232A` | `#FFFFFF` | `#15161C` | 55 |
| dan | Black | `#15161C` | `#FFFFFF` | `#B8232A` (red tape) | — (book bosses) |

Every belt has a thin outline in `--belt-edge` so the white belt shows on light surfaces and the black belt shows on dark ones. The colours are defined once in `KYU` in `js/lib/ranks.js`. The OG templates repeat them, so change them together.

## Type

All four families are from Google Fonts under the SIL Open Font License.

|---|---|---|
| [Bricolage Grotesque](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bricolage+Grotesque) | 700, 800 | Wordmark, headings, belt labels, big numbers. Sentence case, with the wordmark always lowercase. Tracking about −0.012 em at heading sizes. |
| [IBM Plex Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Sans) | 400–700 | Interface text and body copy |
| [IBM Plex Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Serif) | 400, 600, italic | Problem statements, hints and solutions: anything you read carefully. MathJax sits beside it. |
| [IBM Plex Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Mono) | 400, 600 | Answers, points, clocks, ratings and other tabular numbers |

## Icons and link previews

| File | Size | Where it's used |
|---|---|---|
| `assets/favicon.svg` | vector | `<link rel="icon">` (modern browsers) |
| `assets/icons/favicon-32.png`, `favicon-16.png` | 32, 16 | PNG fallback icons |
| `assets/icons/apple-touch-icon.png` | 180 | iOS home screen: mark on indigo, opaque |
| `assets/icons/icon-192.png`, `icon-512.png` | 192, 512 | Web app manifest, `purpose: any`: mark on a rounded indigo tile |
| `assets/icons/icon-maskable-192.png`, `-512.png` | 192, 512 | Manifest, `purpose: maskable`: mark inside the 80 % safe zone on indigo |
| `site.webmanifest` | — | Scope and start URL `/kyuclid/`, so Kyuclid installs separately from Kevinvariant on the same origin |
| `assets/og/og-home.png` | 1200×630 | Home page `og:image` and `twitter:image` |
| `assets/og/problem-template.html` | 1200×630 | Per-problem card: belt, title, topic and answer or proof (example: `assets/og/problem-example.png`) |

**Link previews** use the dark indigo card for the home page and the light card for problems, so the two are easy to tell apart in a feed. A problem card shows only the title, belt, topic and mode, never the statement: contest problem text must stay out of this repo (see rule 1 in `tasks/README.md`).

**Problem pages can't use their cards yet.** Problems live at `#p-<id>`, and link-preview crawlers ignore the part after `#` and don't run JavaScript, so every problem link currently previews as the home page. A problem's card can only be used once the problem has its own static URL with its own `og:image` tags. That is for task 01 or 12 to decide.

**Regenerating.** Install fontTools and Pillow, and have Chrome or Edge available.
- `python tools/brand/build_logos.py <bricolage-800.ttf>` rebuilds every SVG.
- `python tools/brand/render_png.py icons` renders the favicon and app-icon PNGs.
- `python tools/brand/render_png.py og` renders `og-home.png`.
- `python tools/brand/render_png.py problem --id … --title … --kyu … --topic … --mode Answer|Proof` renders one problem card.

The OG pages load their fonts from Google Fonts. If a fetch fails, the render quietly falls back to a system font, so look at each PNG before committing it and re-run if the lettering is wrong.

After any change, bump `?v=` in `index.html` and `site.webmanifest`. Kevinvariant's service worker caches images forever, so without a new `?v=`, browsers keep the old icon.
