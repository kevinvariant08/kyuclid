STYLE = """THE STYLE TO AIM FOR
The problem should read and feel like a real AIME problem: a short, clean statement, no contrived story, one satisfying crux, and an integer answer from 0 to 999, encoded as $m + n$ or similar where the AIME would do that. Use the same kinds of ideas and the same difficulty curve. Sharing an idea family with AIME problems is the goal. Copying is not: never reuse a specific problem's setting, numbers or phrasing, and never write a reskin."""

IDEA_RULES = """How your work is checked. Every point here has rejected real drafts.
- Do not work out the answer by hand. A sandbox runs your program and its output becomes the key, so spend your thought on the idea and on making the statement exact. Keep your reasoning short.
- The key must be an integer from 2 to 999 and must not appear as a number in the statement. Choose the statement's parameters, or ask for a remainder modulo $1000$ or an encoding such as $m + n$ (rule A4), so that this holds. Do not make the encoding the hard part.
- check_program computes the actual quantity from the problem's own definitions: enumerate, search or do exact symbolic work, using exact coordinates for geometry. A judge rejects a program that evaluates a closed formula from the solution, searches a smaller case and then applies a formula, or contains the answer. It must finish within 30 seconds and print only the key on its last line, as a plain integer.
- check_program may import only: {imports}. Never use random, files or the network.
- A strict critic reads the statement for anything a competent solver could read two ways. Define every object, say whether integers are positive, whether pairs are ordered, whether a set may be empty, and whether points lie on sides or on lines. Avoid informal shorthand such as "uses the letters A, B and C"; state exactly what is meant.
- Seven models then solve it blind from the statement alone. Do not rely on a figure: describe every point and condition in words.
- A judge compares it with the source problem and other published problems. It rejects any problem with the same structure and solution path, whatever the setting or numbers, and any well-known problem. A solver who knows the source must still have to think of something new.
- All text uses UK spelling. Use $...$ and $$...$$ for maths, with no custom macros."""

WRITE_RULES = """How your work is checked.
- A strict auditor reads the solution. Justify every non-routine step and every case. Routine algebra may be skipped. It must state the key in the second-last paragraph, and the "Why this works" paragraph follows it as the last paragraph.
- The key comes from a program, so a solution that reaches any other number is wrong. Work it out honestly. If you find the key or the statement is wrong, reply with only <disagree>one sentence on what is wrong</disagree> instead of bending the argument.
- No hint may state the key. Each hint adds something, and the last stops one routine step short.
- All text uses UK spelling. Use $...$ and $$...$$ for maths: \\dfrac in display maths and \\frac inline, always with braces, \\cdot for products and never *, \\le and \\ge. Use only <b> and <code> as markup, and write cases as prose, never as a list.
- The solution's last paragraph is exactly: <b>Why this works.</b> <code>id-one</code>, <code>id-two</code>: one clause on why the idea fits. Each ID must also be in subtopics."""


FIGURE_RULES = r"""THE FIGURE
Every solution to a geometry problem needs a figure, and so does any other solution that argues from a picture, such as complex numbers as points or a coordinate argument. It must look like a careful figure in an olympiad book. Write real tkz-euclide in exactly this shape, and adapt only the content:

%! alt One or two sentences saying what the figure shows, for a reader who can't see it. Name points and lengths.
%! after_paragraph 2
%! scale 1/27
\input{preamble}
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}
%! let R = 195/2
\tkzDefPoint(0,0){O} %! O = (0, 0)
\tkzDefPoint(0,0){A} %! A = polar(O, R, 90)
\tkzDefPoint(0,0){M} %! M = mid(X, Y)
%! fact on_circle(A, O, R)
%! fact dist(X, P) == 64
%! example dist(C, A) == 144
\tkzFillPolygon[color=figtint](B,P,Q,C)
\tkzDrawCircle(O,A)
\tkzDrawSegment[aux](O,A)
\tkzDrawPolygon(A,B,C)
\tkzDrawSegment[key](X,Y)
\tkzMarkRightAngle[size=.2,mk](A,M,Y)
\tkzMarkSegments[mark=|,size=2.5pt,mk](A,B B,E)

\tkzDrawPoints(O,A,B,C)

\tkzLabelAngle[pos=1.3](B,A,C){$40^\circ$}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{document}

Rules. Each one is enforced by a program that rejects the draft.
- Every point is one \tkzDefPoint(0,0){P} line with its exact value after %! P = on the same line. Leave the (0,0): a program fills in the decimals. Never compute a decimal yourself. Don't use any other tkz command that defines or computes a point (\tkzDefMidPoint, \tkzInterLL, \tkzDrawCircle[circum] and so on), \usepackage, \def, \foreach or \input of anything else.
- Exact values may use numbers, + - * / **, sqrt, sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, atan2, sind, cosd, tand, pi, abs, dist(A,B), angle(A,B,C) in degrees, area(A,B,...), x(P), y(P), inradius(A,B,C), circumradius(A,B,C), and these for points: (a, b), mid(A,B), lerp(A,B,t), foot(P,A,B), reflect(P,A,B), rotate(P,O,degrees), polar(O,r,degrees), meet(A,B,C,D), circumcentre(A,B,C), incentre(A,B,C), shift(P,dx,dy). Use the problem's own lengths as coordinates. If the problem has a family of cases, draw one good case.
- Each %! fact is checked to 1e-9: collinear(P,A,B), on_segment(P,A,B), on_circle(P,O,r), concyclic(A,B,C,D,...), perp(A,B,C,D), parallel(A,B,C,D), tangent(O,r,A,B), tangent_circles(O1,r1,O2,r2), midpoint(M,A,B), equal(a,b), or a comparison such as dist(A,B) == 5 or angle(A,B,C) >= 120. State every length, tangency and concyclicity the solution relies on. A number after == must appear in the statement or solution. If it is true only of the case you drew, write %! example instead of %! fact.
- %! scale turns the problem's units into centimetres. Make the drawing about 7.5 cm across. It must fit in 9.5 cm by 10.5 cm with its labels.
- Colours: draw only with the preamble's styles aux (dashed construction lines), key (the one object the argument turns on), mk (marks), lbl (point labels) and len (lengths), and the fills figtint and figaccenttint. Mark equal lengths, right angles and tangency where they help the reader.
- No label may touch another label, a line or a point. Choose each label's side so it sits in empty space.
- after_paragraph is how many solution paragraphs come above the figure, and it comes before the "Why this works" paragraph."""
